If you exceed your monthly event limit, you can now pay *per event* over the limit.  If your overage charge is sufficiently high that it would be more economical to upgrade to the next plan, then we'll do it for you automatically and you won't be charged for the overages.  Here's how it works:

| Plan	| Monthly Cost	| Events/ Month	| Cost per 1,000 events over limit	| *We'll automatically upgrade you if your overage reaches...* |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| Bootstrap |	$49	| 100,000 |	$1.00	| 100,000 events ($100.00) |
| Startup | $149	| 500,000	| $0.60 | 250,000 events ($150.00) |
| Growth	| $299	| 1,500,000 |	$0.40 |	750,000 events ($300.00) |
| Premium	| $599	| 4,000,000 |	$0.30 |	N/A |
				
Once your account has been automatically upgraded, it will remain at the new plan level for future billing cycles.  You can change your plan at any time by going to **Account Settings --> Choose Plan**.  If you choose a lower plan level, the change will take effect at the start of your next monthly billing cycle.

### Overage Billing
Overage charges are calculated at the end of your billing cycle, and are included in the next month's subscription charge.

Here's an example of how this works:

```
Your bootstrap ($49/mo) plan is billed each month on the 10th.

During the period April 10 - May 9, you use 109,532 events (9,532 over your monthly limit).

On May 10th, your monthly charge will be $58.53
* $9.53 for overages during April 10 - May 9.
* $49.00 for your subscription May 10 - June 9.
```

## Upgrade Billing
If your account is upgraded (manually by you or automatically by us), then you will be charged immediately for the difference between your old plan and your new one.  Your monthly billing date will remain the same.

Here's an example of how this works:

```
Your bootstrap ($49/mo) plan is billed each month on the 10th.

On the April 20, you choose to upgrade to the Startup ($149/mo) plan, or your overages exceed 100,000 events.

You are immediately charged ($149 - $49 = $100) for the upgrade to Startup.

Your next charge will be on May 10 for $149.
```
